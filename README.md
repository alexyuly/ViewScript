### Unfinished predecessors of ViewScript
- https://github.com/alexyuly/funstream (currently private)
- https://github.com/alexyuly/lux (currently private)
- Compost (AKA "Chil"): https://github.com/alexyuly/chil/tree/354675d71e9195f38656a33eab851b06700d7c81
  - I think this one actually "works" the most... it builds a working JS/HTML app using webpack that you can open. I think it's a counter app?
  - This was definitely the furthest I had taken this whole idea up to this point.
- TREE ("The Reactive Execution Engine"): https://github.com/alexyuly/TREE
  - Very much incomplete and not at all working in any form
  - Some of the syntactic explorations in the readme could be interesting
- "Turn": https://github.com/alexyuly/turn
  - Contains (an apparently working?) very, very simple "Hello, world" example
